# ChatRedactle

ChatRedactle is an interactive Twitch game where the chat tries to determine the subject of a random obfuscated Wikipedia article.

This whole game was bodged in a few hours. It's a mess.
It mostly works, but things might break, who knows. I will probably not fix issues unless it completely breaks.

## How to

Set your twitch stream username in `config.json`.
