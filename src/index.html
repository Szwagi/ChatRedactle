        <h1>ChatRedactle</h1>
        <p>
          <b>ChatRedactle</b> is an interactive Twitch game where the chat tries to determine the subject of a random obfuscated Wikipedia article.
        </p>
        <p>
          See the bar at the top? See where it says Special:Random? That's the list that the articles are picked from.
          You can create your own lists by creating a .txt file with one topic per line in the /lists folder.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the way, if you couldn't tell, this whole game was bodged in a few hours. It's a mess.
          It mostly works, but things might break, who knows. I will probably not fix issues unless it completely breaks.
